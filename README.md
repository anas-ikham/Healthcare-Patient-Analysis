# Healthcare Patient Analysis with Power BI
##### This Power BI project focuses on analyzing key healthcare metrics related to patient demographics, satisfaction levels, waiting times, and departmental referrals. The goal is to provide insights into patient behavior and healthcare service performance, facilitating better decision-making for healthcare administrators.

##### Using real-world healthcare data, this report visualizes trends in patient visits across various demographics such as race, age, and gender. It also highlights critical metrics like patient satisfaction, average waiting times, and the distribution of patient visits across different departments and days of the week. The interactive dashboards and reports offer a holistic view of hospital operations, aiming to identify areas for improvement in service delivery and patient care.

### The analysis is broken down into the following sections:

#### Patient Demographics: Understanding the population visiting the healthcare facility.
#### Satisfaction & Waiting Time: Correlating patient satisfaction with wait times and service quality.
#### Patient Visit Trends: Identifying patterns in patient visits by time, day, and referral department.
#### Key Insights: Highlighting areas for potential operational improvement, such as reducing waiting times and enhancing service delivery for specific patient groups.
###### This repository contains the Power BI file, the detailed report, and key insights that can be leveraged for optimizing healthcare operations and improving patient satisfaction.

## Key Insights for the Healthcare Project in Power BI
### Patient Demographics:

#### The patient population is diverse, with key representation from various racial groups, including African American (35.56%), White (34.30%), and Asian (34.05%).
#### Patients are distributed across all age groups, with the largest number of patients in the Adult category (7.1K), followed by Middle Childhood and Teenagers.

### Satisfaction Scores and Waiting Time:

#### Average Satisfaction Score: 5.47, with satisfaction being highest for patients with low wait times. The report identifies satisfaction variation across age groups and departments.
#### Average Wait Time: 35.26 minutes. The report shows that wait times are longest for Native American/Alaska Native patients (40.07 minutes) and shortest for Asian patients (32.84 minutes).

### Patient Visits:
#### Total patient visits are dominated by weekday visits (6.6K), with slightly fewer patients visiting on weekends (2.6K).
#### Emergency Room Visits showed that the busiest months were January and February, with patient volumes decreasing during summer months.

### Gender Distribution:
#### The gender breakdown of patients indicates a nearly even distribution between males (48.7%) and females (51.1%).

### Departmental Referrals:
#### Most patients are referred to General Practice (5.4K), followed by Orthopedics (1.8K). Specialized departments like Neurology and Gastroenterology have fewer referrals (around 0.2K each).

## Possible Visualizations for Power BI:
### Bar Charts for comparing patient satisfaction across different races and departments.
### Heat Maps for showing satisfaction scores and wait times across age groups.
### Line Charts tracking total patients per month for both emergency and non-emergency visits.
### Pie Charts for gender distribution and race-wise breakdown of patients.
